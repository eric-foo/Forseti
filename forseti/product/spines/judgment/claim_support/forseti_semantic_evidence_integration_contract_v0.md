# Semantic Evidence Integration Contract v0

## Purpose

Semantic Evidence Integration turns one completed acquisition corpus into a
meaning-aware proposition view before downstream synthesis. It exists because
a large, well-captured corpus can still be underused, misbound to the wrong
product or competitor, or summarized from a convenient handful of citations.

This is a shared Judgment capability. An acquisition route may invoke it as a
pre-seal closure job, but does not own or redefine its claim-support semantics.
The existing intelligence claim-support contract remains the authority for
support posture, independence, conflict, source-role fitness, and causal
ceiling.

It is not a market conclusion, recommendation, sentiment score, representative
estimate, causal model, custom-trained model, embeddings service, vector store,
or graph database.

## Operating location

For broad consumer-brand Understanding:

```text
SERP Phase 1 -> evidence fan-out -> SERP Phase 2 and adaptive returns
-> all selected acquisition jobs terminal
-> Semantic Evidence Integration
-> any affected-axis delta work terminal and integration regenerated
-> acquisition seal
-> Synthesize
```

The integration job may expose a material missing class or emerging axis. The
controller then reopens only the affected acquisition family. Any changed
corpus invalidates the prior integration view; the final seal points only to a
view compiled from the final corpus hash.

## Division of labor

The semantic agent owns only meaning:

- interpret paraphrases rather than match literal wording;
- split one source item when it makes different product, comparator, axis, or
  conditional statements;
- preserve negation, uncertainty, product/version identity, and conditions;
- relate a semantic unit as support, opposition, or adjacent context; and
- nominate an emerging axis when no existing axis fits honestly.

Deterministic code owns:

- the admitted evidence denominator and exact per-alias accounting;
- source-artifact resolution and hashes;
- stable batch, semantic-unit, proposition, corpus, and view identity;
- actor/origin de-duplication and independent-origin counts;
- engagement availability;
- authority-owned source-role competence and impossible combinations;
- claim-support projection; and
- stale/incomplete-view rejection at the acquisition seal.

The agent never chooses its own evidence count, independence count, support
posture, cross-venue credit, or causal strength.

Upstream `product_candidates` are hypotheses, not product truth. For the
current method, every admitted item also carries source-pinned product context
such as a thread title, parent text, post text, product page, creator post, or
source scope. The agent may bind an exact product only from the evidence text
together with that context. Context establishes what the item is about; it
does not donate unstated claims to the item's author. If the binding remains
unclear, the item stays `unresolved` or `out_of_scope`.

## Admitted evidence and completeness

Completeness is bounded to the run's declared admitted evidence set. It never
claims that every raw internet item was captured. Each admitted item must have
exactly one top-level disposition:

- `claim_bearing` — one or more meaning units are emitted;
- `context_only` — useful context but no bounded proposition support;
- `out_of_scope` — outside the bound question/product/cutoff; or
- `unresolved` — meaning or binding cannot be established safely.

Every emitted semantic unit is either used by at least one proposition
relation or receives an explicit unmerged disposition. An absent alias, silent
bulk discard, or unaccounted semantic unit is incomplete. Objective upstream
metadata may define the admitted set; it may not declare that an item lacks a
competitor or material meaning merely because an exact token is absent.

When a captured-but-excluded denominator exists, the completion profile draws
a deterministic bounded semantic audit sample per screening family. One
load-bearing missed class reopens that family rather than licensing a passing
seal from the original screen.

## Axes and propositions

Axes are organizing questions; propositions are the specific bounded meanings
supported or opposed by evidence.

- One proposition may bind multiple existing axes.
- One evidence item may emit multiple meaning units.
- Reusing one evidence item across axes does not create another independent
  origin.
- Existing axes guide interpretation but do not cap discovery.
- An `emerging_axis_candidate` is not automatically promoted into the axis
  inventory. Before a passing seal it is either reconciled into the inventory,
  dispositioned as bounded nonmaterial, or blocks as material.

Route consumers reference proposition IDs. The integration view owns the
claim-support block. Any inline display of that block is a derived projection,
not a second authority, and must not diverge from the referenced proposition.

## Versioned interfaces

`semantic_evidence_bundle_v1` binds the cycle/question, current axes,
hash-pinned source artifacts, admitted normalized evidence units, source-family
denominators, method hash, stable batches, corpus hash, and bundle hash.
It remains reproducible for historical artifacts.

`semantic_evidence_bundle_v2`, selected by
`semantic_evidence_source_v2`, additionally requires at least one normalized,
source-pinned `product_context` row for every admitted evidence unit and binds
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v2`. The v2 method treats product
candidates as hypotheses and fails closed when text plus context cannot bind
the exact product. A v1 bundle cannot satisfy a new route-1.5.0 seal.

`semantic_evidence_batch_response_v1` is agent-authored. It accounts for every
alias and emits zero or more meaning units with precise subject, comparator,
axis, emerging-axis, and condition bindings.

`semantic_evidence_reconciliation_response_v1` is agent-authored. It groups
meaning-equivalent units into bounded propositions, records support/counter/
adjacent relations, states whether opposition was checked, and dispositions
every unused meaning unit.

`semantic_evidence_integration_view_v1` is compiler-authored. It carries final
coverage, propositions, claim-support blocks, emerging-axis candidates,
unmerged meanings, source/method/corpus bindings, and its own content hash.

## No-provider workflow

The runner makes no model API call. It provides four file-based operations:

1. `prepare-batches` verifies sources, builds the bundle, and renders prompts.
2. `submit-batches` validates agent responses and exact alias coverage.
3. `prepare-reconciliation` renders the cross-batch meaning-reconciliation
   prompt.
4. `finalize` validates that response and writes the authoritative view.

The controller gives the rendered prompts to a capable agent in a fresh turn.
The returned JSON is untrusted until the corresponding submit/finalize command
accepts it.

## Failure and seal posture

A passing route-1.5.0 acquisition seal requires:

- a material, terminal `semantic_evidence_integration` route job;
- a completed integration block and resolvable hash-pinned view;
- exact bundle/corpus/method/view hashes;
- `semantic_evidence_integration_method_v2` for a newly sealed route;
- equal admitted and accounted counts with `complete: true`;
- no unresolved material evidence;
- every proposition reference resolved on the axis that cites it;
- every material comparator carries distinct stable subject and competitor
  product IDs, and every cited competitive-choice proposition binds exactly
  those two IDs in that orientation;
- every emerging axis terminally dispositioned; and
- no impossible source-role, independence, repetition, cross-venue, conflict,
  or causal combination.

Uncertainty is preserved rather than repaired. Nonmaterial unresolved evidence
may remain visible; material unresolved evidence blocks the affected claim or
the seal. A changed corpus always requires a new view.

## Historical boundary

This contract enters the Understanding Acquire & Seal route at `1.4.0`.
Historical `1.3.0` and earlier seals retain exactly their stamped obligations
and are never rewritten or restamped to claim semantic-integration coverage.
The context-aware method and stable comparator product-ID requirements enter at
`1.5.0`; a historical `1.4.0` seal retains its original v1 method obligation
and never owes the 1.5.0 additions.
